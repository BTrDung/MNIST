# MNIST

## Introduction
MNIST is a database of handwritten digits available on http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist. The digits have been size-normalized and centered in a fixed-size image.

There are 4 files:
```
train-images-idx3-ubyte: training set images
train-labels-idx1-ubyte: training set labels
t10k-images-idx3-ubyte:  test set images
t10k-labels-idx1-ubyte:  test set labels
```
The training set contains 60000 examples, and the test set 10000 examples.

In this project, i will use a convolutional neural network for handwritten digit classification from scratch.
